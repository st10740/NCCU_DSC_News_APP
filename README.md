# NCCU DSC News App

This project is modified from PopularNews (https://github.com/haerulmuttaqin/PopularNews),
which is an Android project developed in Java, for developing practice purpose.
We add two functionalities to provide better user experience:

- Sort by news category, so people can watch the news as they like conveniently.
- Classify by country where the news is broadcast, which can also help people learn language by watching the correspond news.
